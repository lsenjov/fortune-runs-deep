## Glossary
- Player: You, your friends, and anyone else playing the game.
- Character: The person you play in Fortune Runs Deep.
- Statistic/Stat: Body, Dexterity, Savvy, Intelligence, Fortune
- Skill: Strength, Endurance, Social, etc
- Skill Check: Roll dice (always 2d6) and add the skill, its statistic, and any appropriate profession/proficiency (ie Strength Check to lift weights: d6 + Strength + Body + Profession: Bodybuilder)
- Target Number (TN): The number to equal or beat in a skill check.
- Degree of Success/Failure:  Every 3 a Check is succeeded/failed by is one Degree of Success/Failure.  Degrees of success often mean greater rewards, while degrees of failure often mean terrible setbacks.

Fortune Points (FP):  Spend a Fortune Point to:

1. Re-roll any die directly you roll or is rolled against you (Roll a number of times equal to your Bonus score, and pick two.) e.g. With a Bonus of 3, roll 3 dice and pick the two you want to use, generally high numbers for yourself, or low numbers for an opponent.
2. Add or Subtract your Bonus score from any Skill Check by or against you.

You can spend Fortune Points until you run out.  You get your Return in Fortune Points back each scene (your GM will tell you).

### Skill Checks

1. GM calculates TN (generally 2 + current difficulty)
2. Roll 2d6 + Skill + Parent Statistic + Any applicable profession. In the case of profession checks, the skill is counted twice.
3. Compare to the TN. If equal or greater, you succeed.

### Attacking:

1. To hit:  Roll 2d6 plus your Attack Bonus, minus the weapon's inaccuracy (for range), or slow (for melee).  You must equal or beat the target's avoidance.
2. Roll body part: Roll a d6, adjust up or down 1 for each degree of success on the To Hit roll: 1-2 Left/Right leg, 3-4 Left/Right arm, 5 Torso +3 Damage, 6 Head +6 Damage. If the body part is behind cover, the shot misses.
3. Roll damage:  Roll 2d6, add the weapon's power, and if it is not a firearm add your damage bonus.
4. Reduce Damage:  Subtract the target's Shrug from the damage to a minimum of 1.
5. Check unconscious:  Target rolls a Threshold check, TN equal to the total health lost.  If the check fails, the character is at a negative to all Stats equal to the amount failed by, until the character heals.  Failing by one Degree means the character is unconscious.

### Character
A quick overview of the character sheet:

- Name: Your character’s name.
- Player: Your name.
- Age:  Your character’s age.
- Health Points:  (Body + Endurance + 10)  If this reaches 0, you are dead unless getting some immediate medical attention.
- Fortune Points:  (Fortune + Capacity)  Your total FP.
- Avoidance:  (Dexterity + Speed + Dodge + 7) How hard you are to hit.
- Shrug:  (Body + Toughness + 6) How much damage you ignore when getting hit.  Unless the damage is 6 points less than your shrug, you still take one point of damage.
- Suit:  (♥♦♣♠) The suit of your character.  Relates to the cost of your Statistics and Skills.
- Movement:  (Dexterity + Speed + 6 metres/round) How fast you can move per 2 second round.
- Attack Bonus:  (Dexterity + Aim) How easy it is to hit things when attacking.
- Damage Bonus:  (Body + Strength) Extra damage done with non-firearm weapons.
- Cash Remaining:  How much money you currently have.

To the right of these are your statistics and skills, see the Skills section for more detail.

### Weaponry
- Farm? (Character Sheet Only) Is this weapon a firearm?  Write Yes or No.  If it is a firearm, it does not gain extra damage from Damage Bonus, but is not limited to 4 Range Increments like non-firearms, nor do you lose the weapon by throwing it at range (until picked back up, anyway).
- Dmg (Damage):  How much damage this weapon does by itself.
- Acc (Accuracy):  Each point of Accuracy increased Ranged Attack by 1. Accuracy can be negative.
- Grace:  How easy this weapon is to wield in melee.  Each point of Grace increases Melee Attack by 1. Grace can be negative.
- Ammo:  Firearms only.  How many Bullets can be fired before the weapon requires reloading.  Only 2 Bullets can be reloaded per round, unless there is an ‘s’ next to the number, in which case all Bullets can be loaded in one round.
- Inc (Range Increment):  Each range increment reduces an Attack by 1 point [e.g. A weapon with a Range Increment of 6 metres takes no penalties up to 6 metres, -1 on attacks above 6 metres up to 12 metres etc.].  Non firearms can only be thrown up to 4 increments (-3 Total).

# Full Ruleset

## Difficulty
As Lucky characters shape the world, the world becomes more resistant to their change. The difficulty represents this, constantly making it harder for the players to succeed.

Begin with a difficulty pile of size 2 (a pile of chips or other counter). At the end of each scene, add this to the XP pool, and create another pile one larger (Difficulty rises after each scene.)

At any point, a player may reduce the Difficulty by 6, to a minimum of 0.

At the end of a session, divide the XP pool between the players. This is how much XP each player receives. Divide this number by 3, this is the amount of Fortune XP each player receives.

# Game Mastering

# Starting Characters

Here is a selection of starting characters for players to use.

If the value of a skill is not noted, it is assumed to be the same as the statistic. ("Body 2 Strength 1" means "Body 2 Endurance 2 Strength 1 Threshold 2 Toughness 2")

When a Statistic has two numbers with a slash between, the first number is the Stat's value, and the second is the Skill's value. ("Body 2/1" means "Body 2 All other skills 1")

All characters begin with:
- Fortune 2
- Bonus 2
- Capacity 2
- Return 2
- 0 starting fortune XP
- 1000 total XP
- 360 total fortune XP
